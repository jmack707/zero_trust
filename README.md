# üîê Zero Trust POC Test Plan for F5 Tools

---

## üß≠ Test Plan Overview

### Purpose
This Proof of Concept (POC) aims to demonstrate how F5 solutions can support a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) by enforcing strong identity verification, securing privileged access, and protecting Kubernetes workloads. The POC focuses on three key areas:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
2. **Privileged User Access to Network Devices**
3. **Kubernetes Ingress Security**

### Scope
The POC will simulate real-world enterprise scenarios using F5 BIG-IP LTM, DNS, APM, AWAF, and NGINX Ingress Controller. It will integrate with third-party identity providers and Kubernetes distribution.

### Success Criteria
Each test scenario includes measurable outcomes to validate:
- Proper enforcement of MFA and adaptive access policies.
- Secure, auditable access for privileged users.
- Identity-aware, policy-driven ingress control for Kubernetes workloads.

## 1. üîê Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Tools Involved
- F5 BIG-IP LTM, DNS, APM, and AWAF
- NGINX APP Protext and Ingress Controller
- Identity Provider (Azure AD, Okta, Ping, LDAP etc.)
- Public Key Infrastructure
- RSA Tokens

### Test Scenarios

| Test Case           | Description                                 | Expected Outcome                  | Success Criteria                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| MFA Login           | User logs into a protected app              | Prompted for MFA                  | 100% of login attempts require MFA                |
| MFA Bypass Attempt  | Attempt login from unauthorized device      | Access denied or challenged       | Unauthorized access is blocked or challenged      |
| Adaptive MFA        | Login from trusted vs. untrusted network    | MFA triggered contextually        | MFA is enforced based on risk signals (e.g., IP)  |

### Zero Trust Focus
- Continuous verification
- Context-aware access control

---

## 2. üîê Privileged User Access to Network Devices

### Tools Involved
- F5 BIG-IP APM
- Identity Provider (Azure AD, Okta, Ping, LDAP etc.)
- Network devices

### Test Scenarios

| Test Case           | Description                                 | Expected Outcome                  | Success Criteria                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Role-Based Access   | Admin logs in with elevated privileges      | Access granted per role           | Access is limited to authorized roles only        |
| Session Recording   | Privileged session is recorded              | Session logs available            | 100% of sessions are logged and auditable         |
| Just-in-Time Access | Temporary access granted                    | Access revoked after time window  | Access expires automatically and is logged        |

### Zero Trust Focus
- Least privilege enforcement
- Explicit verification
- Full session auditability

## 3. üîê Kubernetes Ingress Security

### Tools Involved
- F5 NGINX Ingress Controller and APP Protect
- Kubernetes cluster (EKS, AKS, GKE, or on-prem)

### Test Scenarios

| Test Case             | Description                                 | Expected Outcome                  | Success Criteria                                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secure Ingress        | Deploy app with mTLS                        | Only trusted clients access       | 100% of untrusted clients are blocked                             |
| Policy Enforcement    | Apply WAF and rate limiting                 | Malicious traffic blocked         | WAF blocks OWASP Top 10 threats; rate limits enforced             |
| Identity-Aware Routing| Route traffic based on user identity        | Requests routed per policy        | Traffic is routed based on identity claims (JWT, headers)         |

### Zero Trust Focus
- Microsegmentation
- Identity-aware access
- East-west and north-south traffic inspection

## ‚úÖ Test Plan Summary

### Key Findings
The POC successfully demonstrated that F5 solutions can:
- Enforce strong authentication using MFA integrated with enterprise IdPs.
- Provide granular, role-based access control and session auditing for privileged users.
- Secure Kubernetes ingress with mTLS, WAF, and identity-aware routing.

### Business Value
By leveraging F5‚Äôs capabilities, organizations can:
- Reduce attack surface and lateral movement risk.
- Improve compliance with Zero Trust and regulatory frameworks.
- Enhance visibility and control across traditional and cloud-native environments.

### Recommendations
- Proceed with phased deployment of F5 solutions aligned to Zero Trust principles.
- Integrate with existing IAM and PAM systems for centralized policy enforcement.
