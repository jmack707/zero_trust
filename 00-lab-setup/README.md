## üöÄ High-Level Workflow

The major tasks involved in building and automating this lab environment are:

1. **Deploy BIG-IP Declarative Onboarding (DO) and Application Services 3 (AS3) RPMs:**  
   üõ†Ô∏è Use Ansible Playbooks to upload and install F5 RPM packages on the BIG-IP device.

2. **Update BIG-IP Device Configuration:**  
   ‚öôÔ∏è Configure BIG-IP interfaces, VLANs, self-IPs, and routing using Ansible.

3. **Push Application Configuration:**  
   üìú Apply application-specific configurations and enable advanced routing/security profiles using AS3.

4. **Test Zero Trust Use Cases:**  
   üîí Verify the environment using Kubernetes workloads, simulated applications, and virtual network segmentation.

## üåê Network Architecture

The lab environment includes several IP subnets to segregate management, external, and internal communications, as illustrated by the following network diagram:

### Network Subnets

| Subnet | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `10.1.1.0/24`  | **Management (MGT)**: Provides access to BIG-IP admin interfaces and monitoring portals. |
| `10.1.10.0/24` | **External (EXT)**: Handles external-facing traffic and application access. |
| `10.1.20.0/24` | **Internal (INT)**: Manages internal application communication. |
| `10.1.30.0/30` | **Point-to-Point (MGT-BIG-IP P2P)**: Point-to-point connection between the management router and BIG-IP. |

### Network Topology

The following network diagram represents the environment's topology, highlighting Kubernetes clusters, BIG-IP devices, applications, and management tools:

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### üì• Provision BIG-IP
1. Download the BIG-IP VE OVA file (`BIGIP-17.5.0-0.0.15.ALL-vmware.ova`) from the F5 website.
2. Deploy BIG-IP VE on your virtualization platform, e.g., VMware or VirtualBox.
3. Assign the management interface an IP address from the `10.1.1.0/24` network.

---

### üì¶ Deploy Declarative Onboarding (DO) and Application Services 3 (AS3)
1. Use the following Ansible Playbook to upload DO and AS3 RPMs onto the BIG-IP:

```bash

ansible-navigator run  download_atc.yml --mode stdout
ansible-navigator run  install_atc.yml --mode stdout

```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Update Device Configuration
- Update the device configuration files location at files/do to match to your environment.

---

### üìú Push Device Configuration
- Apply application-specific policies using Declarative Onboarding (DO) and AS3:

```bash

ansible-navigator run  do_onboarding.yml --mode stdout
```

---

## üîí Testing Zero Trust Use Cases

Once the BIG-IP, Kubernetes, and web applications are configured, you can proceed to test Zero Trust principles:

1. [Multi-Factor Authentication](/01-MFA/)
2. [Privileged User Access](/02-Privileged_Access/)
3. [Kubernetes Ingress](/03-Kubernetes_Ingress/)
